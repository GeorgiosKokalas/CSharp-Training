Constructor:
It is a special method which shares the same name as the class and doesnt have a return type, not even void

Constructors is used to create an object of the class and initialze class members
if there is no constructor in the class, the compiler provides a default constructor
Default constructors does not take any input parameters
If we create any other constructor, the default constructor will be replaced
Constructors can be overloaded
Constructors cannot be inherited so a contructor cannot be overridden
By defualt, derived class constructor will make a call to the base class parameterless constructor
--Static constructor will run first before other constructors
